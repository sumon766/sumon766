### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Sumon

I have been a student of engineering and have learned to work hard, think technically, and always be careful about the deadlines to meet. This has also taught me to face new problems every day, and stay up to date with the latest technologies in the field.

On the other hand, I have completed the course in Microverse Full Stack Software Development Program and learned to work in a remote environment, doing pair programming remotely with partners around the world. 

I have completed almost 10 capstone projects during the course work, which were made using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Currently, I am working on a library project where advanced javascript and object-oriented programming concept has been used along with accessibility for all kinds of disabled people to make sure best user experience.

Alongside this, I scored 6.5 in IELTS and completed a Diploma in Information and Communication Technology. The thing I am proud of myself for is taking on challenges without the fear of losing because I think if I lose, I will get to learn something new.

These experiences have made me more confident in communication, coding, and teamwork.

I'm now looking for a position as a Junior Software Developer in a company like Fiverr where freelancers provide service to people over the world and I want to help them serve in an easier way. 

I would love to connect with you if you're interested in learning more about my skills and experience. Thank you for your time.
